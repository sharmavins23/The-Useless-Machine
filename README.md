# The Useless Machine
This project is a small python text game made for a [Text Jam](https://itch.io/jam/python-text-programs-will-win). It's based off of popular YouTube mechanisms of robotics turning on and off switches.
## How To Run
Open main.py in IDLE, and run it using F5, or with Python's run feature.
